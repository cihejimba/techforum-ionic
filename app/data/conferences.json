It allows to a standard Android application to perform NFC card emulation (a SE-less payment card for instance) in mobile handsets. This feature could allow Worldline to issue NFC “cards” without the need of a Trusted Service Manager (TSM). Currently, in order to integrate an application into a SIM card, the issuer of the application requires an interface with a TSM, an agreement with the owner of the SIM card (Telco operator) is required to loan a “place” in the SIM Card and the installation of the application is under the responsibility of this operator. Thanks to the HCE, such a scenario is not required anymore. During this presentation, we will present an “how to” section in which we will present how to use HCE in your application. We will present the basic Android functionalities and introduce the API we have designed that let you have a standalone card application, a bridge to a local secure element, and a distributed card application. The second part of our presentation will be a security analysis of an application that mimics a real secure element. In particular we will see that new requirements arise to secure the application: implementation of an authentication scheme of your application in front of your server, protection of sensitive data inside the App through a tamper resistant component, etc. The third part will be dedicated to the countermeasure we have at disposal. We will review pure software countermeasures; these ones are mainly based on our SEA components. SEA is our Strong authentication method working on a purely software environment. We will review the hardware approach; using a secure element embedded in a micro SD, or using the trusted zone of the embedded processor. The trusted zone is a minimal physical counter measure that can withstand all software attacks - Samsung’s Knox being is an implementation of this concept. Finally in the last part, we will present the demo we have developed around Meal Voucher dematerialization. In this setting, we are designing an Android application that stores the Meal vouchers of the user and a prototype implementation on a Worldline Terminal of a single tap acceptance of Meal Vouchers and Paypass payment.","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534514b156c06970c1000010","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"PaaS Cloud Hosting","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534514ca56c06941c2000012","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Payment terminals: User interface against security","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534514e256c06970c1000011","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Rules learning as an ergonomic prediction model for fraud transactions","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534514f956c06941c2000013","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"STASH UP","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345152056c06970c1000012","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Samsung Knox : securing smartphone apps","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345154456c06970c1000013","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Search in Encrypted Text","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345157056c06941c2000014","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Set off on a trip with EVA","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345159056c06970c1000014","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Strong authentication using fuzzy extractors","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534515c756c06941c2000015","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Strong authentication using fuzzy extractors","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534515de56c06970c1000015","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Test quickly with Docker.io !","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345161f56c06941c2000016","author":"Dalila HATTAB","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Trend Analysis of Time series","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345163b56c06970c1000016","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"TrustZone in POS environment","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345168256c06941c2000017","author":"Guillaume Bailleul","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Using JPPF Framework to parallelize processing on a Grid","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345169c56c06970c1000017","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Vagrant, chef, puppet, docker : where are we ?","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534516b156c06941c2000018","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Vote!","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534516c256c06970c1000018","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Web configurator","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534516d956c06941c2000019","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"WebCL fallback in pure javascript","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345171f56c06970c1000019","author":"Nourredine Khadri","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Website content optimization : A/B testing and more","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"5345176a56c06941c200001a","author":"Antoine Fressancourt","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"What's between my mobile and my server: an introduction to mobile networks","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534517a356c06970c100001a","author":"unknown","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"Who said JS can’t be tested ?","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1},{"_id":"534517e356c06941c200001b","author":"Amaury Willemant","day":1,"theme":"null","title":"You're not service-oriented enough !","when":{"start":"09:00","end":"09:45"},"where":1}]
